              Between 2013 and 2016 <span class="emphasis">36.6%</span> of the American adults, around <span class="emphasis">84.8 million</span> people, consumed fast food on any given day.

            <p>"We focused on fast food for this report because fast food has played an important role in the American diet in recent decades," said Cheryl Fryar, first author of the report and a health statistician at the CDC. "Fast food has been associated with poor diet and increased risk of obesity."</p>
            <p>Fast foods tend to be high in calories, fat, salt and sugar, which when consumed in excess can be associated with obesity, high blood pressure, Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, among other health risks.</p>

            <p>The new report included data on about 10,000 people 20 and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013-2016. The data revealed that fast food consumption varied by age, income level, race and sex.</p>
            <p>The percentage of adults who said they consumed fast food rose with family income level, according to the report.</p>
            <p>"What surprised me was the finding that income was positively associated with more fast food," said Dr. Lawrence Cheskin, an associate professor and director of clinical research at the Global Obesity Prevention Center at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the new report.</p>
            <p>"That connection or correlation is opposite of what I perhaps would have expected," he said. "But we need these kinds of studies and these kinds of facts and statistics to get a better understanding of what drives the use of foods that, as a nutrition expert I would say, are not your first choice for a variety of reasons."</p>
            <p>Cheskin, who is also director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center, emphasized that foods high in sugar and fat can raise the risk of certain chronic health problems. "People have the lowest health risk when they eat fruits and vegetables and whole grains," he said.</p>

      <p>The report has some limitations, including that the subjects' dietary information was obtained through in-person interviews during which the adults recalled what they had eaten in the past 24 hours. Such recall interviews could lead to underreporting and other issues.</p>
